# ComfyZone

A small, fast, tap-to-protect game built for the Swift Student Challenge.  
Youâ€™re guiding a girl whoâ€™s climbing out of the deep â€” out of her comfort zone â€” while grasping hands reach for her. Your only job: tap the hands before they touch her.

## Gameplay
- **Goal:** Keep the character safe for **60 seconds**.
- **Two phases:**
  - **0â€“30s:** Normal hand speed.
  - **30â€“60s:** Hand speed increases.
- **Win:** Survive the full minute without any hand reaching the character.
- **Lose:** If a hand touches the character, the game ends immediately.

## Controls
- **Tap** any approaching hand to remove it.
- Thatâ€™s itâ€”pure reaction and focus.

## Why this project?
A compact experiment about leaving the comfort zone: simple rules, rising pressure, and a finish line you can feel.

## Tech
- Swift / SwiftPM
- Designed for Xcode (macOS)
