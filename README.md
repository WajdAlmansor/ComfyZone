A small, fast, tap-to-protect game built for the **Swift Student Challenge**.  
You’re guiding a girl who’s climbing out of the deep, out of her comfort zone, while grasping hands reach for her.  
Your mission: **tap the hands before they grab her down**. ✋🚫  

## 🕹 Gameplay
- **Goal:** Keep the character safe for **60 seconds** ⏱  
- **Two phases:**
  - **0–30s:** Normal hand speed 
  - **30–60s:** Increased hand speed 
- **Win:** Survive the full minute without any hand reaching the character 🏆  
- **Lose:** If a hand touches the character, the game ends immediately 

## 🌱 Why this project?
A compact experiment about leaving the comfort zone: simple rules, rising pressure, and a finish line you can feel.
